BATTLESHIP

The game is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

The game will be played on an 8x8 board numbered A-H (columns) and 1-8 (lines). Each player will
place 1 battleship (4 squares), 1 cruiser (3 squares) and 1 destroyer (2 squares). The computer places
its ships randomly. The program will prevent both players from placing ships that reach out of the
playing area or which overlap.
To help the player, the game will display both the player’s grid as well as its “targeting” grid, that
contains information about the player’s ‘hits’ and ‘misses’.
NB! We do not expect you to implement optimal play on the part of the computer player. However, it
should still employ a strategy when making its moves in order to attempt to win the game and provide
an entertaining opponent for the human player.
